# Truffle-PetShop

### Overview

In this project I wanted to get more knowledge behind the smart contracts using Truffle framework. They had a Pet Shop project that I was able to understand breaking down the parts of the smart contract in detail. Learned about the directory structures such as migrations/, contracts/, test/ and config file for Truffle. I was also able to learn about the ganache local blockchain to test transactions of the contract. Here I was able to see the transactions, the contract and the ETH change on the local address itself. I still will need to add the UI for the front end works, but decided to separate the repo for understanding. Peace.
